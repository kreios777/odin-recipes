                a small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture, 
                blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes 
                are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
