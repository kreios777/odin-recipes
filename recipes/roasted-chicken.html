            for beginner and pros alike.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter or margarine</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion 
                powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange 
                dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; 
                place in the chicken cavity.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the 
                juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest for
                about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p class="tip">You know the chicken is done when the meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear.</p>
